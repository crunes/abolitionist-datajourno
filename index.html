		<p class="title">Towards an Abolitionist Data Journalism Practice</p>

		<div id="intro" class=tabcontent>
	    <p class="intro">
				This website is an ongoing project by <a href="#about" onclick="openTab(event, 'about')">Charmaine Runes</a>,
				a Chicago-based developer, designer, and journalist. This micro-site
				was born out of generous conversations with other (data) journalists, abolitionist
				friends, as well as classmates for a course on prison industrial complex
				abolition. It explores and builds on a question she has had for a while
				and will likely think about for the rest of her life:
			</p>
			<p class="intro">
				What might an abolitionist data journalism practice look like?
			</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<p>
				But first, a few definitions:
			</p>
			<h4>What is the prison industrial complex?</h4>
			<p>
				This project uses Critical Resistance’s definition of the prison
				industrial complex (PIC), which is “the overlapping interests of
				government and industry that use surveillance, policing, and imprisonment
				as solutions to economic, social and political problems.” The PIC
				encompasses not only police departments and prisons, but also carceral
				approaches to child welfare, schools, and social work. The PIC manifests
				at every scale, from the interpersonal to the structural.
			</p>
			<h4>What is abolition?</h4>
			<p>
				Critical Resistance defines abolition as “a political vision with the
				goal of eliminating imprisonment, policing, and surveillance and creating
				lasting alternatives to punishment and imprisonment.” PIC abolition is
				doing away with cages and creating conditions that prevent violence. It is both the horizon and the small actions we take every day to
				build another world, the kind where no one is disposable and everyone
				has what they need to grow and thrive.
			</p>
			<h4>What is data journalism?</h4>
			<p>
				Data journalism is simply journalism based on collecting, analyzing, and
				interpreting data. Although the term is relatively new, journalists have
				been using data for their reporting for a long time. It often (but not
				always) involves visualizing data using charts, and using the data to
				provide deeper context to a story and improve its accuracy. And while
				data journalism is used in newsrooms all over the world, this project
				mostly focuses on data journalism in the United States.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="context" class=tabcontent>
	    <h1>Context</h1>
	    <h2>An incomplete history of data journalism</h2>
			<p>
				One of the earliest records of data journalism in the United States was
				an 1849 story and chart by <a href="https://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/infographics-in-the-time-of-cholera?utm_content=buffer9314e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer">the New York Tribune</a>, illustrating the number
				of people who had died from cholera. In 1858, across the Atlantic,
				<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/aug/13/florence-nightingale-graphics">Florence Nightingale</a> presented her now-famous coxcomb diagrams to describe
				the different causes of death for the British Army.

			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Clearly, data journalism is not new, but what distinguishes these
				simple—but powerful—tabulations from modern-day data journalism is the
				sheer speed and scale at which we can generate, access, and analyze data
				today using computers. In 1952, <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2014/today-in-media-history-in-1952-a-univac-computer-helped-cbs-news-predict-the-winner-of-the-presidential-election/#:~:text=On%20November%204%2C%201952%2C%20CBS,would%20win%20in%20a%20landslide.">CBS News</a> covered the presidential
				election night using a Remington Rand UNIVAC computer, correctly
				predicting Eisenhower’s landslide victory. And in 1967, <a href="https://investigatingpower.org/philip-meyer/">Philip Meyer</a>
				(at the time a freelance journalist with the Detroit Free Press) used
				survey research methods to report on the Detroit uprisings that summer
				and later, the civil rights and anti-war movements. Meyer called this
				computer-assisted approach to reporting “precision journalism”.
			</p>
			<p>
				As computers grew faster and cheaper, more and more newsrooms began
				using them for their reporting. In 1989, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
				received a Pulitzer Prize for its computer-assisted reporting on racial
				disparities in home loan practices. That same year, the Missouri School
				of Journalism and the Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc.
				established the <a href="https://www.ire.org/about-ire/">National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting
				(NICAR)</a> to support and train journalists to use data for their
				investigative work. Today, large legacy newsrooms like the New York
				Times have entire desks and news products like The Upshot dedicated to
				collecting, cleaning, and making sense of massive amounts of data.
			</p>

			<br>
			<h2>Data + journalism + the myth of objectivity</h2>

			<p>
				Names like computer-assisted reporting, precision journalism, and data
				journalism might suggest that this kind of reporting is more accurate
				and more objective than other forms. But is it?
			</p>
			<p class="highlight">
				What does data have to do with journalistic objectivity?
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 19th century, newspapers were often openly aligned with specific
				political parties and issues, including enslavement and abolition. But
				writing and running stories that exposed state violence and condemned
				the country’s white supremacist status quo resulted in threats and
				physical harm against reporters and editors that did so.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1829, <a href="https://www.biography.com/writer/david-walker">David
				Walker</a>, a Black abolitionist and Boston agent for Freedom’s Journal
				(the country’s first newspaper that was both Black-owned and managed),
				wrote a pamphlet that used the Bible and the Declaration of Independence
				to argue against enslavement and encourage other Black people to fight
				for their freedom. Soon after
				he distributed his pamphlets, there was a $1,000 reward for his death
				and a $10,000 reward if he was captured alive. In 1837, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elijah-P-Lovejoy">Elijah P. Lovejoy</a>,
				a white Presbyterian editor, was killed in Alton, IL, for publishing
				anti-enslavement literature in his newspaper.
			</p>
			<p>
				But towards the start of the 20th century, newsrooms dropped their
				political patrons in favor of advertisers. Relying on advertisements
				meant prioritizing circulation and reaching as many people as possible.
				A parallel force behind the push for nonpartisan media was <a href="https://time.com/5443351/journalism-objectivity-history/">the closing
				or merging</a> of several newsrooms across the country in the 1920s, which
				encouraged the remaining shops to appeal to the broadest swath of the
				population.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 1940s, the mainstream journalist’s job was very similar to that
				of a stenographer; they simply reported what powerful people said and
				did, with little commentary or critique. But by the time the 1960s came
				around, reporters covering then-President McCarthy’s outrageous claims
				pushed back.
			</p>
			<p class="highlight">
				It was not enough to report “the facts”; journalists and
				newsrooms were also responsible for telling the truth about the facts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The centrality of facts and the discipline of verification became of
				utmost importance; so too was the idea that journalists be “objective”
				and their reporting dispassionate and disinterested. Reporters were
				expected to portray issues and events in a neutral way, regardless of
				their personal feelings. This standard has also meant that reporters
				with lived experience are discouraged or prevented from writing about
				their communities because their reporting would be too biased. And
				although many reporters and scholars have offered new paradigms for
				journalistic truth-telling, several—particularly marginalized
				journalists—have faced harsh consequences.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lewis Raven Wallace, author of The View From Somewhere: Undoing the
				Myth of Journalistic Objectivity, argues that “objectivity” has been
				used to silence marginalized reporters (himself included), as far back
				as data journalist <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/16/8979771/ida-b-wells-lynching-data">Ida B. Wells-Barnett</a>. Wells-Barnett collected and
				used data to expose and protest the horrors of lynching. In 1895, she
				published a pamphlet called <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14977/14977-h/14977-h.htm">The Red Record: Tabulated Statistics and
				Alleged Causes of Lynching in the United States</a>. She also wrote an
				article, <a href="https://carceralfeminism.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/idabwells1.pdf?utm_content=bufferf9c37&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">Lynching and the Excuse for it</a>, as a scathing response to Jane
				Addams. Addams was against lynching, but she had argued that lynching
				spectators might “honestly believe that that is the only successful
				method of dealing with a certain class of crimes”—that is, Black men
				charged with raping white women—and should be given the benefit of the
				doubt.
			</p>
			<p>
				But Addams’ generosity was based on the false assumption and widely-held
				white public perception that the majority of those lynched had been
				charged with that specific crime in the first place—and Wells-Barnett had
				the facts to prove it. She drew up multiple tables tallying the number of
				Black people who were lynched and the justification by year, from 1896 to
				1900. The percent of Black people whom white mobs lynched for a rape
				charge was the lowest category each year. In 1900, less than fifteen
				percent of those lynched were charged with rape.
			</p>
			<p class="highlight">
				“The table tells its own story, and shows how false is the excuse which
				lynchers offer to justify their fiendishness,” Wells-Barnett concluded.
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea that data talks is a popular one; so too is the idea that data
				(especially quantitative data) is neutral, “objective”, and consequently,
				authoritative. But Rob Kitchin, author of The Data Revolution: Big Data,
				Open Data, Data Infrastructures & Their Consequences, provides the
				following definition of data: “what we understand as data are actually…
				those units of data that have been selected and harvested from the sum
				of all potential data.”
			</p>
			<p class="highlight">
				Data, he continues, are “inherently partial, selective, and representative,
				and the distinguishing criteria used in their capture has consequence.”
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words, data—be it qualitative or quantitative, structured or
				unstructured, primary or secondary—is constructed. Datasets represent
				not only categories, but also the specific choices of the dataset’s
				creator. And at every stage of data journalism, reporters make similarly
				subjective choices: what data to use, what variables to analyze, how to
				“clean” a dataset, how to visualize a trend, what data points to highlight,
				and what language they use to explain what the data mean.
			</p>
			<p>
				Data doesn’t talk; the humans who make sense of the data do.
			</p>

			<br>
			<h2>Data journalism + reimagining the world</h2>

			<p>
				Data and data journalism often tells us what is, but it can also tell us
				what can be. Using data in investigative and watchdog journalism, for
				example, can help expose harm and provide critical, accurate information
				to those committed to and organizing for social change. Using data to
				simulate and explain policy changes that free people in cages, house
				people experiencing homelessness, educate children equitably, or
				redistribute wealth can also help readers imagine alternative ways of
				being in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Seek out researchers and organizers experimenting with new ways to keep
				their communities safe.
			</p>
			<p>
				Talk to mutual aid groups about the funds they’ve collected and
				distributed to their neighbors; ask them what impact looks like.
			</p>
			<p>
				Show people that another world is, in fact, possible.

			<h1>Praxis</h1>
	    <p class="intro">
				Moving towards or building an abolitionist data journalism practice can
				look different for different people. Some might have the ability to join
				a news organization dedicated to <a href="https://niemanreports.org/articles/158195/">movement or solidarity journalism</a>, and
				others might not.

				But data journalism is first and foremost an activity
				and skill, not a profession, and skills can be applied and shared in many
				settings.
			</p>
			<p class="highlight">
				Here are some ways to consider building that practice, for
				yourself and in community:
	    </p>

			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>

			<h2>Learn about prison industrial complex abolition</h2>
			<p>
				Read and listen to articles, books, blogs, and podcasts about PIC
				abolition by abolitionists. Reflect on carceral assumptions and narratives
				you’ve held on to yourself. Talk to others about what you’re learning and
				what questions you still have.
			</p>

			<br>
			<h2>Avoid narratives + language that legitimize the prison industrial complex</h2>
			<p>
				When using data to illustrate the harms of the PIC, use language that
				recognizes the dignity of the people involved. Avoid narratives that
				frame prisons or police as fix-able given enough financial resources
				and time.
			</p>

			<br>
			<h2>Understand what + who your data represent</h2>
			<p>
				Crime data, like the kind the City of Chicago releases, is easy to
				access. The City website notes that it pulls 90 days’ worth of data
				from the Chicago Police Department's (CPD) CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement
				Analysis and Reporting) system. CPD includes the following disclaimer:
			</p>
			<p class="long-quote">
				These crimes are based upon preliminary information supplied to the
				Police Department by the reporting parties and have not been verified.
				The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date
				based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility
				of mechanical or human error. Additionally, crimes not reported within
				97 days of occurrence would be excluded from this dataset. Therefore,
				the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or
				implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing
				of the information and the information should not be used for comparison
				purposes over time. The Chicago Police Department will not be responsible
				for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained
				from the use of this information.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some questions you can ask before you work with a dataset:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who collected these data, and for what purpose?</li>
				<li>What makes this a legitimate source?</li>
				<li>What critical questions do this data NOT answer? What data are missing?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For example, if you’re working with murder registry data, ask yourself,
				“Do these data represent murderers, or do they represent people who have
				been convicted of murder?”
			</p>
			<p>
				And remember, data about an issue is not inherently more valuable,
				trustworthy, or true than information gleaned through interviews with
				those directly impacted or personal experience.
			</p>

			<br>
			<h2>Connect the dots</h2>
			<p>
				In her 1982 Malcolm X weekend address at Harvard University, Audre
				Lorde said:
			</p>
			<p class="highlight">
				“There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle, because
				we do not live single-issue lives.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, there is no such thing as
				a single-issue story, and an abolitionist data journalism practice should
				reflect that.
			</p>
			<p>
				The #NoCopAcademy campaign in Chicago, IL, for example, was more than
				just a fight to prevent the construction of a $90 million police training
				academy on the West Side. It was also about historical disinvestment by
				the city to West Side neighborhoods, as well as the Black and brown youth
				building power and community in spite of it. As Benji Hart, Chicago-based
				organizer, put it, “The police beat is the housing beat is the education
				beat.”
			</p>

			<br>
			<h2>Share skills + resources beyond your profession</h2>
			<p>
				If you are not in a position to or decide not to make your living from
				movement journalism, build relationships with others who you can continue
				to learn from. Organize within your newsroom. Connect with organizers and
				campaigns and see how you can support their work.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Darryl Holliday wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review:
			</p>
			<p class="highlight">
				“A healthy
				and democratic future demands that the skills journalists possess be
				distributed among many—not bestowed on a select few. The journalists we
				need today are not heroic observers of crisis—they are conveners,
				facilitators, organizers, educators, on-demand investigators, and
				community builders. Most of all, they strengthen the systems that make
				communities resilient.”
